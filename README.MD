Java class console application in wich we have 
a maze generator (done without particular algorithm for now) which generate solvable maze with a start and goal pos and save them into files or zip file depending on the arguments.
a maze solver (using Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path from the start point to the goal point) which takes in argument a labyrinth file name or a labyrinth zip file name to solve them.
a maze displayer which displays the mazes and solved mazes.
